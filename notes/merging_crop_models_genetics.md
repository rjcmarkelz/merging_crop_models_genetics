# Merging Crop Models and Genetics Notes

## Day 1

### Morning Session
The traits that we are interested in are quantitative. Vallejos discussing overview of challenge from a physiological perspective. Showing basic QTL mapping with overlapping distributions. This is a nice slide representation, main limitation of QTL from modeling perspective is a single endpoint. Dynamic traits in a single environment have a different problem (Penn State Collaborators have solved this). 

Cultivar data --> phenotype --> crop model --> GSPs --> crop model 

For the gene based crop sym, you can see the output of the model and the output of the phenotyping and see what the overlap is.

See Drawings in Notebook.
